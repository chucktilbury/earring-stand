# Earring Organizer

This is a simple FreeCAD project that demonstrates using a spreadsheet to
hold related dimensions for several drawings.

The *.3mf files are Creality slicer project files.

First load dims.FCStd then load the others. These can then be modified using
the spreadsheet in dims. You will have to "refresh" the drawings with CTRL-R
to see the changes.
